    If someone targets you online by saying mean things, trolling, spreading rumours or excluding you, this counts as bullying (or 'cyberbullying'). Bullying can happen on social media platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook or Minecraft. Online bullying might also occur alongside abuse in your school or workplace, by your peers, boss or colleagues.

    Bullying is not tolerated on social networking sites and can be reported directly to these platforms.

    In the UK there is no specific legislation around cyberbullying. Certain types of cyberbullying could, however, fall under harassment, hate speech or malicious communications. These are considered criminal and are against the law. You should report harassment or hate speech to the police on 101.
