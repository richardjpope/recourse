    There may be times when you come across distressing content on social media platforms. This might include content promoting suicide or people expressing suicidal thoughts, content glorifying eating disorders (such as anorexia or bulimia), and depictions of self-harm and self-injury (e.g. self-cutting, scratching, burning or biting).

    Suicidal content is often against platforms community guidelines, and so the first thing to do is to report it to the platform where you first saw the content.
